# useful-Astro-scripts
A dump of simple scripts I have quickly cooked up for particular problems I have faced


CSVtoVOtable.py: I used this to plot a
catalog of RGB stars used in https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2022/04/aa43307-22.pdf  (https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03662)
on top of a HI moment 0 map, the catalog was in a csv file, but the visualisation software I used (CARTA https://cartavis.org/)
only takes VOtable inputs for catalogs
